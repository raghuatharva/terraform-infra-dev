# What ansible do here;

#1. we created a backend like instance 
#2. with ansible , we install everything ie. new version of application
#3. after that we get launch template from that and trigger ASG

# Also note that , we are updating ASG without checking whether the new version is doing well or not ; Blindly updating ASG without verifying app = Instant Disaster in Production. ðŸš¨

#we should check manually everything and if its good then only you delete the instance and trigger ASG
